            <h2>Welcome to Tech knowledge,</h2>
            <p>The first benefit of technology for students is that they are able to access knowledge at any time and place of their choice. These days, technology has progressed to such a level that no longer is learning confined only to the walls of the classrooms. Gone are the days when the students in schools and colleges had to wait for classes so that they could clear their doubts. This was applicable for all topics out there. They can now use technology in order to clear those doubts. They are able to do it at any place that they choose to and at any time that they are comfortable with.</p>

              <p>  Technology has also brought forth the concept of distance education, which means that students can take part in classes in a virtual manner as well.</p>
             <p>Just think of a classroom, which does not use any technology at all. In those classrooms, the teachers are unable to say anything more than what they themselves know. This means that the students would never get to know more than what their teachers know especially if they limit themselves to what they are learning from the classrooms. Things have now changed and much of the credit, in this case, needs to be given to technology. Students these days have access to the internet. In case they do not like what their teachers are teaching or if they are just curious to know about things they can always look up the internet.</p>
