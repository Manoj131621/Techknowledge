            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>TechKnowledge is a locally owned, family owned and operated Technology/IT Business in Midland, MI. Our storefront location is in the Nakrekal. We opened doors back in 2021 with the name. Then, in 2021 we updated our name to TechKnowledge. The name change better reflects who we are and what we do. Same owner, same great service!
